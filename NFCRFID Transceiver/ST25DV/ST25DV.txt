**Explanation**

I²C Address: 
 - The default I²C address of the ST25DV is 0x53. You can verify or modify this depending on your specific module.
I²C Functions: 
 - We use the Wire.h library for I²C communication to send and receive data from the ST25DV tag.
Memory Block Access: 
 - ST25DV's memory is organized in blocks, and you can read/write data block by block. Each block in ST25DV memory typically holds 16 bytes.


**Functions**

checkConnection(): 
 - This function checks if the ST25DV module is connected and responsive.
writeDataToST25DV(): 
 - Writes a string of data to a specified memory block. The function pads the data if it’s shorter than 16 bytes.
readDataFromST25DV(): 
 - Reads 16 bytes of data from a specified memory block and returns it as a string.

**Wiring**

SDA -> Arduino SDA (A4 on most Arduino boards)
SCL -> Arduino SCL (A5 on most Arduino boards)
VCC -> 3.3V
GND -> GND


**Testing**

 - Connect the ST25DV module to the Arduino using the wiring above.
 - Upload the code to your Arduino.
 - Open the serial monitor to observe the data being written and read from the ST25DV module.

**Key Points**

Memory Organization: 
 - You can extend this example to read and write from different memory blocks, change block addresses, or handle more complex features like interrupt configuration.

Data Transmission: 
 - Modify the data writing/reading function as needed for specific data structures or longer sequences.
