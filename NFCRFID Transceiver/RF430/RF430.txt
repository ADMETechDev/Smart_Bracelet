**Explanation**

I²C Address: 
 - The default I²C address for the RF430CL330H module is 0x28. You may need to adjust it depending on your setup.
Memory Addressing: 
 - This code writes and reads data from the RF430’s SRAM. The starting address 0xF868 is part of the RF430's memory, which is dynamically used to store data exchanged via NFC.
checkConnection(): 
 - This function checks whether the RF430 module is responding correctly by sending an I²C request and checking for an acknowledgment.
writeDataToRF430(): 
 - Writes data to the specified memory address in the RF430’s SRAM. You can modify the address and the length of the data as needed.
readDataFromRF430(): 
 - Reads a specified number of bytes from a given memory address in the RF430's SRAM.


**Memory Layout**

The RF430CL330H memory map is divided into areas like SRAM (used for dynamic data exchange) and NDEF memory (used for NFC communication). The address 0xF868 used in the example refers to a commonly used memory region, but you can adjust this based on your memory layout.

**Wiring**

SDA -> Arduino SDA (A4 on most boards)
SCL -> Arduino SCL (A5 on most boards)
VCC -> 3.3V
GND -> GND

**Steps to Test**

Connect your RF430CL330H module to the Arduino using the wiring above.
Upload the code to your Arduino.
Open the serial monitor to see data being written and read from the RF430.

**Key Points**

Memory Mapping: 
 - The RF430CL330H uses specific memory regions for various operations (NDEF messages, interrupts, dynamic data). This example writes to its SRAM for dynamic interaction.
Data Transmission: 
 - The code demonstrates basic I²C read/write operations, which you can extend to handle other RF430CL330H features like interrupt handling or NDEF message writing.
