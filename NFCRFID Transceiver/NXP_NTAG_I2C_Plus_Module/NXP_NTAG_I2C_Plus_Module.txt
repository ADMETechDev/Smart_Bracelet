Wire Library
 - We use the Wire.h library to handle I2C communication between the Arduino and the NTAG I2C Plus.

NTAG I2C Address
 - The default I2C address of the NXP NTAG I2C Plus is 0x55.

checkConnection(): 
 - This function verifies if the NTAG I2C module is responding by attempting to communicate with it over I2C.

writeDataToNTAG(): 
 - This function writes a string to the specified memory page of the NTAG I2C module. NTAG memory pages typically consist of 4 bytes, and weâ€™re writing to 4 consecutive pages (16 bytes).

readDataFromNTAG(): 
 - This function reads 16 bytes (4 pages) of data starting from a specified memory page.
