The TTP229 is a capacitive touch digitizer module that can detect touches on multiple keys. It is often used in touch-based applications for creating custom user interfaces. The module communicates using an I2C interface, making it relatively straightforward to interface with the ESP32. Below is an example of how to work with the TTP229 touch digitizer module using an ESP32.

**Explanation**

Initialization:
 -Wire.begin(21, 22): Initializes I2C with the specified GPIO pins for SDA and SCL.

Reading Data:
 - Wire.beginTransmission(TTP229_ADDR): Begins communication with the TTP229 module.

Wire.write(0x00): 
 - Writes a request to read data from the status register (0x00).

Wire.endTransmission(): 
 - Ends the communication.

Requesting Data:
 - Wire.requestFrom(TTP229_ADDR, 2): Requests 2 bytes of data from the module.

Wire.read(): 
 - Reads the high and low bytes of touch data.

touchData: 
 - Combines the high and low bytes into a single 16-bit value.

Processing Data:
 - The touch data is a 16-bit value where each bit represents the state of a touch key. The code checks each bit to determine if a key is touched.

Output:
 - The touch data and the status of each touch key are printed to the Serial Monitor.
