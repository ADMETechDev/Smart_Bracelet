**Explanation**

SoftwareSerial: 
 - Used to communicate with the SIM28ML module using pins 3 (TX) and 4 (RX) for serial communication.
NMEA Sentences: 
 - The SIM28ML GPS module outputs GPS data in NMEA format. The code captures and processes $GPGGA sentences, which contain useful data such          as latitude, longitude, and fix quality.
Parsing GPGGA Sentence: 
 - The code extracts fields from the $GPGGA sentence using the positions of commas to split the string. 

Important fields include:
 - Time (UTC time of position fix)
 - Latitude and Longitude (position)
 - Fix Quality (type of GPS fix)
