**Explanation**

HardwareSerial: 
The ESP32 has multiple hardware serial ports, and here HardwareSerial is used to communicate with the u-blox MIA-M10 GPS module on pins 16 (RX) and 17 (TX). Make sure these pins are properly connected to the GPS module's TX and RX pins.


**NMEA Sentence Parsing**
 - The GPS module outputs standard NMEA sentences like $GNGGA (GPS fix data). The code processes these sentences and extracts GPS 

information such as:
Time (UTC time of position fix)
Latitude and Longitude (position)
Fix Quality (whether the GPS fix is valid)

**Serial Monitor Output**
 Extracted GPS information is printed to the Serial Monitor. You can expand the parsing logic to include more NMEA sentences like $GNRMC, which also contains date and speed information.
