***Key Components of the Code***

SoftwareSerial:

gsmSerial(2, 3): A software-based serial port using pin 2 as the RX pin and pin 3 as the TX pin.

gsmSerial.begin(9600): Initializes the software serial communication at 9600 baud (a common rate for GSM modules).

Serial Communication:

Serial.begin(9600): Sets up the hardware serial port (default one) for communication with the computer.
The main serial port is used to print debug information and interact with the user.

***Code Walkthrough***

1. setup() Function:

Serial and GSM initialization:

Serial.begin(9600): Starts communication between the microcontroller and your computer for debugging and user input/output.

gsmSerial.begin(9600): Starts communication with the GSM module at 9600 baud.

delay(1000): Gives the GSM module some time to power up and initialize before starting communication.

Making a phone call:
makeCall("1234567890"): Calls the function makeCall() to dial the phone number "1234567890". You should replace this number with the desired one.
Serial.println("Making a phone call..."): Prints this message to the Serial Monitor as a status update.
2. loop() Function:
This function runs continuously after setup(). It handles two things:

Reading data from the GSM module:
if (gsmSerial.available()): Checks if there's any data available from the GSM module.
Serial.write(gsmSerial.read()): Reads the data from the GSM module and forwards it to the serial monitor so you can see responses from the GSM module, such as call status or other messages.
Sending user input to the GSM module:
if (Serial.available()): Checks if there's any user input available from the serial monitor (your computer).
gsmSerial.write(Serial.read()): Forwards user input from the serial monitor to the GSM module, allowing you to send AT commands manually if needed.
3. makeCall() Function:
This function initiates a phone call by sending AT commands to the GSM module.

gsmSerial.println("AT"): Sends the basic AT command to check if the module is responsive (returns "OK" if successful).
gsmSerial.print("ATD"): Starts the AT command to dial a number (ATD is the "Dial" command).
gsmSerial.print(phoneNumber): Adds the provided phone number to the ATD command.
gsmSerial.println(";"): Finishes the command with a semicolon (;), which is required to tell the GSM module to dial the number.
delay(1000): Gives the GSM module some time to process the command before moving forward.
Serial.println("Calling..."): Displays a message in the Serial Monitor to let the user know that a call is being made.
4. endCall() Function:
This function sends the ATH command to the GSM module to hang up the current call.

gsmSerial.println("ATH"): Sends the "Hang Up" AT command.
delay(1000): Waits for the GSM module to process the hang-up command.
Serial.println("Call ended"): Prints a message to the Serial Monitor indicating that the call has ended.
Summary:
The code communicates with the GSM module using AT commands via a software serial interface.
It dials a phone number using the ATD command, and you can monitor GSM responses and enter custom commands from the serial monitor.
It has functions to start and end phone calls (makeCall() and endCall()), and continuously monitors incoming data from the GSM module.
